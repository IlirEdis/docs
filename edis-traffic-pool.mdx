#### EDIS Virtual Server Traffic Pool

**Tired of upgrading your KVM tier for more traffic? EDIS Has the Solution!**

Here at EDIS, we know that running out of traffic can be a real pain. That's why we're excited to announce our new **traffic pool feature**! With a traffic pool, you can "hydrate" your VPS with traffic from the pool, before it is running dry.

To make it easy for you, we created two traffic zones rather than having a variety of different traffic-prices for our over 40 locations.

The **Global Traffic Zone** is the standard traffic zone for [all EDIS VPS locations](https://www.edisglobal.com/#server-locations), and it sets the base price point. The **Premium Traffic Zone** applies to places where bandwidth is more expensive: [UAE/Dubai](https://www.edisglobal.com/vps-server/united-arab-emirates-dubai), [Australia](https://www.edisglobal.com/vps-server/australia-sydney), [Chile](https://www.edisglobal.com/vps-server/chile-vina-del-mar) and [Colombia](https://www.edisglobal.com/vps-server/colombia-bogota). Keep reading to learn more about our new traffic pool feature.

##### **How Your Traffic Pool Works**

1.  To get started with our new traffic pool feature, simply top-up through the cart. [https://manage.edis.at/whmcs/cart.php?gid=214](https://manage.edis.at/whmcs/cart.php?gid=214)
2.  Once the payment has gone through, traffic will be added to your pool and your balance will be displayed on every KVMs management page, in the new "Traffic Information" window. You'll also find information about which traffic zone your VPS runs in. This is particularly important to understand, because traffic in the Premium traffic zone is more expensive.
3.  Use "Hydrate KVM from pool" buttons to assign pool-traffic to your KVM plan in +100GB, +500G, or +1TB increments.

<div class="note-callout">Adding traffic to a KVM in the Global traffic zone withdraws exactly the same amount of traffic from the pool. Adding traffic to a KVM located in the **Premium traffic zone**, **withdraws 2x the amount** you add to your KVM.</div>
