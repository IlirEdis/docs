#### Solution if you did not receive email with EDIS VPS credentials

The email with credentials was sent to you right after we received your payment. In case you did not receive our email, this is what you can do to start using your VPS:

1.  log in to your KVM panel* at [https://manage.edis.at/whmcs/clientarea.php](https://manage.edis.at/whmcs/clientarea.php)
2.  locate your VPS in the services tab
3.  reinstall your VPS with a fresh password and the OS of your liking

* log in with your account email address and the password you set when you signed-up (when you placed the order)
