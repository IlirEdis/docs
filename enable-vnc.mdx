#### VNCÂ allows you to remotely control a VPS through a graphical interface

Through the KVM management portal, you can enable VNC for each VPS individually. Once VNC is turned on, **noVNC** or a **desktop VNC client** can be used to connect.

1.  Locate your VPS in the [Services](https://manage.edis.at/whmcs/clientarea.php?action=services) menu
2.  Click "**Enable VNC**"

    <div class="note-callout">**Note down the password** to authorize a desktop VNC session!  
    The password is **<u>not required for noVNC</u>**</div>
