#### **Does EDIS announce my own IP addresses?**

You can bring your own prefixes and use them with our dedicated servers.

A one-off (NRC) fee for the BGP announcement applies.

There are no monthly fees for maintaining announcements.

<div class="note-callout">You can use your own IP ranges with EDIS dedicated server products.  
EDIS does not allow the use of third-party IP prefixes in its KVM / VPS range of services.</div>
