  Configuring aditional IP address on you EDIS VPS
---

If you obtained an additional IP address for your KVM, it will not be added to your server's network settings automatically. You have to manually configure the IP address in your operating system's network configuration. Before you add or update any IP addresses on your VPS, make sure to restart your service (reboot). Doing so updates the ethernet bridge's firewall and allows your VPS to communicate with the internet.  

A clean reinstall configures all IP addresses automatically, but all data on your KVM will be erased.  

Below are instructions on how to add a secondary IP address to your KVM.

#### Adding an IP address in Debian Linux or Ubuntu

On your server with primary IP 192.168.1.1 on eth0  
you want to add the secondary IP of 192.168.1.2 as follows  

**edit** /etc/network/interfaces
```bash
nano /etc/network/interfaces
```
**add** the following 2 lines at the end of your config:

    auto eth0 iface eth0 inet static   address 192.168.1.1   netmask 255.255.255.0   gateway 192.168.1.254 post-up ip a a 192.168.1.2/24 dev eth0 pre-down ip a d 192.168.1.2/24 dev eth0

After editing, run the command **sudo ifup eth0:0** to activate the new interface.

#### Adding an IP address in CentOS

On your server with primary IP 192.168.1.1 on eth0  
you want to add the secondary IP of 192.168.1.2 as follows  

Log in as user root and navigate to your **/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts** directory.  
In this folder you find your network interface config file(s).  
```bash
    # ls -l | grep ifcfg-eth -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 119 Jan 11 19:16 ifcfg-eth0
```
Clone (copy) the primary adapter configuration file _ifcfg-eth0_ and  
name it after the first virtual adapter _ifcfg-eth0:0_

    # cp ifcfg-eth0 ifcfg-eth0:0 # ls -l | grep ifcfg-eth -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 119 Jan 11 19:16 ifcfg-eth0 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 119 Feb 24 08:53 ifcfg-eth0:0

**edit** the file ifcfg-eth0:0, and use the following configuration for this virtual adapter.  

static IP  
remove hardware address (MAC)  
configure the IP address and netmask  
rename the device from eth0 to eth0:0  

    DEVICE=eth0:0 BOOTPROTO=static ONBOOT=yes IPADDR=192.168.1.2 NETMASK=255.255.255.0

After editing you will have to restart the networking service  
with the command **service network restart**
