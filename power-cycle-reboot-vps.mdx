#### How to power-cyle your EDIS VPS

You can power-cycle or reboot your VPS from the KVM management panel.

Locate your VPS in the [services](https://manage.edis.at/whmcs/clientarea.php?action=services) menu and then click **"Shutdown"** or **"Reboot".** After a shutdown, you can **"power on"** your VPS again.

Alternatively, you can trigger **"shutdown -h now"** or **"halt"** at the command prompt, followed by a **"power on"** through the panel.
