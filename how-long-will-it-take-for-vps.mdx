#### How long does it take to deliver my VPS order?

EDIS wants to ensure a great experience for all of our customers. In order to successfully welcome new clients, there are some essential checks that need to be completed first.

If you have paid with **Crypto,** it typically takes **6 confirmations on the blockchain** till our payment processor (Coinbase Commerce) reports the payment to us. For **PayPal** and **Credit Card payments**, it takes **less than a minute** for the payment to clear. Once the **payment has cleared**, your server will be **delivered** **instantly**.

**What if it takes longer ...**

In some rare occasions, we can't deliver your order and need to fulfill further compliance checks. EDIS team would reach out to you for additional information or offer a refund.
