#### How to request Cancellation for your EDIS VPS

VPS can be cancelled in the [KVM management portal](/l/en/article/2eu6teryw7-edis-kvm-management-panel) at any time. Locate the VPS in the [Services](https://manage.edis.at/whmcs/clientarea.php?action=services) menu, and click **"Request Cancellation."**

Cancel **immediately** or **at the end of the billing period**.

<div class="note-callout">Our services are based on **MONTHLY** **subscriptions** rather than daily. We understand that sometimes you may need to discontinue a service prior to the completion of the subscription period. Unfortunately, in those cases, **we cannot provide a refund** for any portion of the subscription that has already been paid. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.</div>
